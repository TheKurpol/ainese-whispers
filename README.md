# Ainese whispers

Welcome to the game where AI tries to disrupt your communication as far a possible! Like in popular childhood "chinese whispers" game, you create a message and then try to share it with as little changes as possible but instead of literal "whisper" here your message will be passed through image generator and all your friend will be left with is created image and a little hint you've given him. Will you still overcome these disruptions and manage to get your message across? Check yourself! 

# How to play

In the first round, you need to fire up the imagination and make a sentence that the other players will shortly need to guess. You need to remember that the model will most probably misinterpret the meaning and noone would be able to figure out what you originally wrote (especially when one of your friends is starring in your sentence). Thus you can add a hint containing up to 20 characters.
